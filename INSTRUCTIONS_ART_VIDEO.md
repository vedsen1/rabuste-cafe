Please add your video file to the following location:
`src/assets/art/art-video.mp4`

I have updated the **Art Page** code to look for a video file at this specific path.

Once you add the file:
1. Name it `art-video.mp4`.
2. Place it in the `src/assets/art/` folder.
3. The video section on the Art Page will automatically display it.
