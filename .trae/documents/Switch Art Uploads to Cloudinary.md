I will create a step-by-step guide (`CLOUDINARY_SETUP.md`) to help you get the necessary credentials.

**Plan:**

1.  **Create `CLOUDINARY_SETUP.md`**: This file will explain exactly where to click on the Cloudinary dashboard to:
    *   Find your **Cloud Name**.
    *   Create an **Unsigned Upload Preset** (crucial for uploading without a backend server).

2.  **Wait for Credentials**: Once you follow the guide and give me the `Cloud Name` and `Upload Preset`, I will then proceed to code the changes (creating the service and updating the upload logic).

I will start by creating the guide for you.
