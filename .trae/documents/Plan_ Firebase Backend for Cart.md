Understood. I will **skip the Firebase backend for the cart** and stick to the frontend changes for the Menu page layout.

**Revised Plan:**

1.  **Update `Menu.tsx`**:
    *   I will modify the rendering loop to **exclude** `'Robusta Cold'` and `'Robusta Hot'` from the main list.
    *   The "Our Specialty" section will remain the *only* place where Robusta items are shown.
    *   The main menu list below will start directly with **Blend**.

I will apply this change now.
