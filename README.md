# ☕ Rabuste Cafe Website

Welcome to the **Rabuste Cafe** project! This is a modern, responsive website built for a coffee shop, featuring a dynamic Menu, Art Gallery, and Workshops section managed via a secure Admin Panel.

## 🚀 Getting Started (Beginner's Guide)

Follow these simple steps to get the website running on your computer.

### 1. Prerequisites (What you need installed)
Before you start, make sure you have **Node.js** installed.
- [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Choose the "LTS" version).
- [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Recommended code editor).

### 2. Install Dependencies
1. Open the project folder in **VS Code**.
2. Open the **Terminal** (Click `Terminal` > `New Terminal` in the top menu).
3. Type the following command and press **Enter**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   *This downloads all the necessary libraries to run the website.*

### 3. Run the Website
Once the installation is complete, start the local server by typing:
```bash
npm run dev
```
You will see a link like `http://localhost:5173`. **Ctrl + Click** on that link to open the website in your browser.



## 📂 Project Structure
- **`src/pages`**: Contains all the main pages (Home, Menu, Art, Admin, etc.).
- **`src/components`**: Reusable parts of the website (Navbar, Footer, Admin Managers).
- **`src/services`**: Logic for connecting to the database (adding/fetching data).
